      "## Machine Learning\n",
      "Quite a few machine learning questions focus on predicting an outcome based on a set of features. Linear regression with gradient descent is a supervised learning technique. The machine learns the best fitting linear function from a training set, which it uses to predict outcomes based on feauture values it has never 'seen' before.  "
